# Hi there!

Welcome to Graphique's webOps den :D

If you are here we're gonna assume you liked our websites and are eager to know how they work. 

Ufortunately, they are all private repos :( 

But... Hold on.. 
We at Graphique are currently working to make it Public! 
The codebase is currently protected untill we are able to make a full security audit so that our webiste or our data is not compromised in any way due to the open sourcing the codebase. 

You can expect it to be public real soon! 

Meanwhile we will be publishing some of our experiments as public repos, for anyone and everyone to collab or contribute to. Look forward to those!

If you have any bug reports to make or any issue sto raise, you can create an issue in this repo and the mods will get working on it! 

The codebase is currently managed by [Priyanshu](https://asthana001.me/), [Yagnesh](https://yagneshlp.me) and [Hameed](https://hameedibrh.com). Contact them if you have any particular requests/issues or if you wanna apprecite their work ;)

Thanks for dropping by!
